 |  Description: Usage:
 |                    Prog1A file.csv
 |               Reads in a csv file which has the following format:
 |                    -The first line is the column names
 |                    -Each subsequent line is a record with 9 string fields and
 |                        4 integer fields
 |                    -Fields are separate by commas. If a field is empty, there
 |                        are two commas
 |                    -If a field has a comma as part of its string, the entire
 |                        field is surrounded with quotation marks
 |               The program reads through this and stores it as a binary file
 |               with the same basename, so if the file is file.csv, the output
 |               will be file.bin. Each record is made the same size by padding
 |               the strings to match the largest string in that respective
 |               column. The 9 string maxes (integers) are stored at the
 |               beginning of the binary file, and then right after that is all
 |               the records.
 |
 |     Language: Java 16
 | Ex. Packages: None
 |
 | Deficiencies: I know of no deficiencies in the code.

    /*---------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Constructor Record(line)
    |
    | Purpose: Constructs a Record object from a line from the csv file,
    |     Populating the 9 string fields array and the 4 int fields array
    |      accordingly.
    |
    | Pre-condition: Assumes the line has 13 fields separated by commas, and
    |     that the first 9 fields are string (within quotes if there is a
    |     comma within the string) and the last 4 are integers (within
    |     quotes if there are commas in the number). Assumes there is no
    |     new line at the end of the line and that all integers have only
    |     digits in them.
    |
    | Post-condition: The stringFields and intFields fields will be populated
    |     with the respective values from the line passed in.
    |
    | Parameters:
    |     line -- a line from the csv file with 13 comma separated fields, no
    |         new line at the end.

    /*---------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Method dumpRecord
    |
    | Purpose: Writes this record to the binFile by writing the 9 string fields
    |     and then the 4 ints. To make sure this record is the same size as
    |     the others in the binFile, it uses stringMaxes which contains 9
    |     integers and pads each string according to the respective stringMax
    |     with spaces on the right of the string.
    |
    | Pre-condition: Assumes the binFile pointer is at the end of the file.
    |     Assumes stringMaxes has 9 ints, one for each respective max string
    |     length, and also assumes that each stringMax is longer than the
    |     length of the respective string in this record.
    |
    | Post-condition: The information for this record will be in the binFile,
    |     with the binFile pointer being moved past the record.
    |
    | Parameters:
    |     binFile -- binary file, ready for another record to be written to it,
    |         left off at the last record
    |     stringMaxes -- array of 9 integers, each representing the amount
    |         which to pad the respective string field of the record
    |
    | Returns: None.

    |  Method getTotalCreditsIssued
    |
    |  Purpose: Retrieves the total credits issued value from this record. Used

    |  Returns: The first integer field which is the totalCreditsIssued

    | Method compareTo
    |
    | Purpose: Compares to another record by comparing the first integer field
    |     of each, the total credits issued. Used for sorting records.
    |
    | Pre-condition: The record o being passed in is a valid record with its
    |     fields already populated.
    |
    | Post-condition: Nothing is changed.
    |
    | Parameters:
    |     o -- other record.
    |
    | Returns: Negative if this record has less total credits issued than other
    |     record, 0 if same number of records, positive if more credits than
    |     other record.

 || Class Prog1A
 ||
 ||        Author: Baylor Warrick
 ||
 ||       Purpose: Runs the main functionality of part A of Project 1. Reads in
 ||           a csv file and creates Record objects. Sorts the records by
 ||           total credits issued (10th field of each row/first integer field),
 ||           Then writes the records in order into a binary file with the same
 ||           base name as the csv file passed in as a command line argument.
 ||           It will guarantee that each record is the same size by padding the
 ||           string fields to the maximum length string. It also stores the
 ||           stringMaxes (the maximum length for each of the 9 string fields;
 ||           each as an integer) at the beginning of the file so that when
 ||           reading the file, we know how long each field is.

    |     record in the file. Scanner sc is at the end of the file now.

    |         of the file
